This script takes an ORF-TVthek URL from command line and extracts a
wmv file using streaming. This script was working at time-stamp above
with Wheezy Debian GNU/Linux and mplayer version r34540. It might
break in case of changes of ORF-TVthek.

There are several other scripts on github which do the same
job. This script is my version and has great error handling,
cool debug messages, and a log file in case of a problem on the way.

Depends on: cat, sed, grep, wget, mplayer (>= r34540)

Enabling debug mode: please edit "./gettvthek.sh" in function "debugthis()".
